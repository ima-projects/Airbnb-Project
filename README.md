## Business Problem
### Objective 
2016 was a very informative year for Airbnb stakholders. The business problem is to analyze the historical data of Airbnb listings in the year 2016 and create a comprehensive visualization that will enable stakeholders to understand why some areas were overperforming while others were underperforming. The visualization will help in identifying the underlying factors that contributed to the success or failure of Airbnb listings in different areas and help stakeholders make informed decisions about the future investments in the platform.

### Goal
Stakeholders who would be interested in understanding the performance of Airbnb listings in different areas in 2016 could include Airbnb executives, investors, property owners, and potential guests looking to book accommodations on the platform. The visualization could help executives and investors make strategic decisions regarding future investments in certain regions, while property owners could gain insights into how to better market their listings to attract more guests in the current macro-economic climate in 2023.

## Preliminary Analysis
The technique used here will compose of a data visualization and descriptive statistics, in place of an exploratory data analysis. The selection of these techniques are predicated upon the assumption that the data has already been preprocessed and normalized. This thereby eliminates the need to conduct a more thorough analysis. However, where this need does arise, more in-depth technique will be performed that is conducive to the business goals, or financial objectives of the company. 

Here, a data visualization and descriptive statistical techniques can help to identify patterns and trends in the data, as well as any potential outliers or anomalies that may need further investigation.

## Types of Graphs
- Line charts: used to display trends over time.
- Bar charts: used to compare different categories of data.
- Geographic maps: used to display data spatially on a map.

  - This provides a strong indication to suggest that this an area that may have higher demand for Airbnb bookings, potentially due to factors such as proximity to popular tourist attractions, business districts, or other local amenities. 
  - Further investigation and analysis could help to identify the specific reasons for the higher demand, and potentially uncover opportunities for businesses in the area to capitalize on this trend. 
- Additionally, understanding the reasons behind the lower demand in other areas could provide valuable insights and opportunities for improvement in those locations. 
- Overall, these findings can be leveraged to inform strategic business decisions and drive growth in the Airbnb market in Seattle.
